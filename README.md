This project is described in depth in the article https://medium.com/@Jim_reich/ellipto-electric-imp-meets-keen-io-b581a8c17b13

Enjoy building it, feel free to contribute (send me a pull request), distribute, and extend the ideas, please let me know what you get up to. If you want to make it into a commercial product, drop me a line, I'm both reasonable and have lots of ideas on where to go with it.
